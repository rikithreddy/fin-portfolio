# The Hidden Fee Epidemic

Banks are masters of small, forgettable charges. My job is to remember.

## The Audit Process

I developed a fee detection algorithm that flags any transaction labeled as:
- Maintenance fee
- Service charge
- Convenience fee
- Processing fee
- Paper statement fee

## Findings

Over 24 months, my client had paid:
- $144 in paper statement fees (they never opened them)
- $96 in ATM fees from out-of-network machines
- $60 in minimum balance fees (easily avoidable)
- $40 in wire transfer fees (cheaper alternatives existed)

**Action:** Switched to e-statements, identified free ATM networks, and consolidated accounts. Annual savings: $170+
