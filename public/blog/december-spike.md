# The December Spike

Context is the difference between "overspending" and "living". 

I noticed a massive spike in the "Entertainment" cluster. A generic app would flag this as "Poor Financial Health".

## Contextual Analysis

By overlaying calendar data, I confirmed these 3 days correlated with a milestone birthday event. 

**Insight:** This wasn't a habit; it was an outlier event. My models now account for "Celebration Exclusion" to avoid false positives in budget alerts.
