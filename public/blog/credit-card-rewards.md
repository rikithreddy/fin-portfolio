# The Unclaimed Rewards Problem

Most people treat credit card rewards as a bonus. I treat them as receivables.

## The Analysis

By cross-referencing transaction categories with card reward structures, I found my client was using the wrong card for 40% of their purchases.

Their dining card offered 4% back on restaurants, but they were using their 1% general card out of habit.

## The Recovery

Additionally, 12,000 reward points were set to expire within 30 days. Quick redemption saved approximately $120 in value.

**Action:** Created a simple card-category matching guide. Annual impact: $180+ in recovered value.
