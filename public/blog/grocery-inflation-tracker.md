# Your Personal Inflation Rate

The government says inflation is 6%. Your wallet disagrees. Why?

## The Methodology

I built a personal CPI tracker by categorizing 18 months of grocery transactions and tracking unit prices for frequently purchased items.

The data revealed:
- Dairy: +31% YoY
- Fresh produce: +18% YoY
- Packaged goods: +12% YoY

## The Insight

My client's actual grocery inflation was 23% - nearly 4x the official rate. This wasn't overspending; it was genuine price increases on their specific basket of goods.

**Result:** Armed with this data, they negotiated a cost-of-living adjustment at work using their personal inflation metrics as evidence.
