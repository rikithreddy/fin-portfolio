I shared my credit card statement data of months with a friend who was experimenting with data analysis. He built some really interesting models and dashboards to study my spending patterns — and the results were surprisingly insightful!


His analysis helped me see that I’ve been spending a lot on groceries but very little on health and entertainment — which really made me rethink my priorities. He even spotted a small anomaly where I had unknowingly lost ₹590 due to a fuel surcharge I hadn’t noticed — and thanks to his analysis, I got it back!


I’m genuinely impressed by how data analysis can turn everyday information into actionable insights. Huge thanks to Rikith Reddy for doing such a fantastic job — not only was it a great learning exercise for him, but it also benefitted me in understanding and optimizing my personal expenses.


📊 Data truly has the power to reveal what we miss in our daily lives!
